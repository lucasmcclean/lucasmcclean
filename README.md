# Lucas McClean

I build web applications at the UCF Techrangers using Python and JavaScript.
In my free time, I enjoy working on backend systems in Go and low-level tooling
projects with Rust. My system runs Linux (Gentoo, Fedora, Arch) and I use
Docker, Bash, and Neovim daily. I've also worked with Postgres and MongoDB.

## Projects Under Development

- [LimitLink](https://github.com/lucasmcclean/limitlink) —
    A URL shortener where you can set time-based or use-based limits.
    (In progress)

- [TTCG](https://github.com/lucasmcclean/ttcg) —
    A 'Terminal Trading Card Game' inspired by fastfetch/neofetch and
    numerous TCGs.
