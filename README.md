**I'm a Computer Science student with a focus on fullstack and backend systems.**

I have a little over two years of experience in software development. I've experimented with game, terminal, web,
and native app development but I've found a love for fullstack and backend. My experience is primarily in building
backend web applications with Go, Docker, and PostgreSQL.

Though I spend most of my time on backend, I'm always on the lookout to learn about and try new things. I'm always
collaborating with others because that's where I find my greatest love for software development. When the opportunity
presents itself to learn a new technology or work on a team I'd be hard-pressed to pass up on it.
