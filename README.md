# Lucas McClean

I build web applications at the UCF Techrangers using Python and JavaScript.
In my free time, I enjoy working on backend systems in Go and low-level tooling
projects with Rust. My system runs Linux (Gentoo, Fedora, Arch, Void) and I use
Docker, Bash, and Neovim daily.

## Projects Under Development

- [xcrdtbl](https://github.com/lucasmcclean/xcrdtbl) —
    An experimental CRDT library to try out different CRDT approaches with the
    goal of improving ergonomics and efficiency.

- [TTCG](https://github.com/lucasmcclean/ttcg) —
    A 'Terminal Trading Card Game' inspired by fastfetch/neofetch and
    numerous TCGs.
