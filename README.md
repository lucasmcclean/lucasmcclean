# Lucas McClean

I build web applications at the UCF Techrangers using Python and JavaScript.
In my free time, I like experimenting with backend services in Go and
low-level tooling projects with Rust. My system runs Linux (Gentoo, Fedora,
Arch) and I use Docker, Bash, and Neovim daily. I've also worked with Postgres
and MongoDB.

## Projects Under Development

- [LimitLink](https://github.com/lucasmcclean/limitlink) —
    A URL shortener where you can set time-based or use-based limits.
    (In progress)

- [Kitenv](https://github.com/lucasmcclean/kitenv) —
    A cross-platform workspace manager to keep development environments
    consistent. (In progress)
