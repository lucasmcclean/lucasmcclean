# Lucas McClean

Over the past ≈3 years, I've worked on numerous open-source projects with teams
of many sizes. For the last year, I've been developing and maintaining software
that serves 70,000+ students at UCF Techrangers. Much of my experience is in
backend systems and CLI tools, but I also like to try new things frequently.
In several hackathons, I've worked on ML projects and games (my team won "Best
Game" at [Knight Hacks VIII]).

For personal projects, Rust and Go are two of my favorite languages, but I also
frequently use Python. The challenges I most enjoy working on involve software
architecture, API design, and balancing practical design with efficiency.

Right now, I'm working on [kvd], a key-value diffing and merging tool
that's generic across file types. I also love researching – recently I've been
reading about CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) and some of my work
can be seen in [xcrdtbl].
